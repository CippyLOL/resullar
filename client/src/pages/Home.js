                    <h1>Why Resullar?</h1>
                    <p> One edge that the application has is that it accommodates job seekers of varying skill sets
                        and experiences. Our team has also seen a lack of support to those applicants whose skills
                        are more technical and less academically focused. <br /> <br />
                        Such applicants usually belong to two main collar jobs - blue collar jobs and pink collar jobs.
                        Other than white collar jobs, these other two categories cater to different roles in different
                        industries where having a degree is not always required. </p>
