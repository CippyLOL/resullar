            <h1>What is Resullar?</h1>
            <p>Resullar is a resume builder that provides an effective layout for users to use, which will 
                enable hiring managers to see their talents and skills in the best way possible. </p>
                
            <h1>Why Resullar?</h1> 
            <p> One edge that the application has is that it accommodates job seekers of varying skill sets 
                and experiences. Our team has also seen a lack of support to those applicants whose skills 
                are more technical and less academically focused. 
                Such applicants usually belong to two main collar jobs - blue collar jobs and pink collar jobs. 
                Other than white collar jobs, these other two categories cater to different roles in different 
                industries where having a degree is not always required. </p>
